                Our refund and returns policy is in accordance with statutory rights under the Consumer Contracts Regulations. This might sound formal but simply means all products must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and as described.
                We can only offer refunds for items if they arrive damaged. If there are issues with your item, we are happy to offer you a refund for the amount of the damaged item. Please contact us via email on support@ondg.co.uk. A member of our customer service team will assist you as soon as possible.
